# Software Testing Concepts

## 🔍 What Defines a Software Bug?

When working in software development or testing, understanding the root causes of software bugs is crucial. I’ve broken down five key conditions that can lead to a bug, summarized in the mind map below:

1️⃣ Fails to perform a required function.  
2️⃣ Performs something it shouldn't.  
3️⃣ Exhibits unmentioned behavior.  
4️⃣ Omits a function that should be included.   
5️⃣ Is difficult to use, understand, or just feels "not right" to the end user.

Whether you're a tester, developer, or product manager, keeping these in mind can help enhance product quality and user satisfaction!

## 🚨 The Rising Cost of Bugs 🚨

As developers, we all know that bugs can be a costly problem. But did you know the cost to fix them increases exponentially as we move through different phases of the development lifecycle? 🧑‍💻💸

📊 The earlier a bug is caught — during the specification or design phase — the cheaper and easier it is to fix. But once we hit the release phase, that same bug can cost much more to resolve!

This highlights the importance of:   
✅ Thorough planning and design  
✅ Regular code reviews and testing  
✅ Early and continuous testing throughout development

By catching issues early, we not only save money but also improve the quality and reliability of the product! 💡
