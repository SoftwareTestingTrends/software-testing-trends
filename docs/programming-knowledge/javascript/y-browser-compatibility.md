The new ES6 syntax has greatly improved readability and efficiency of JavaScript but the ES6 syntax is not supported by most web browsers, so developers often run into browser compatibility issues.

There are different ways to handle these issues: 

* caniuse.com — This site provides data on web browser compatibility for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site also allows checking browser support on a feature-by-feature basis. 
* Babel — A Javascript library that is used to convert unsupported JavaScript (ES6) into an old version of JavaScript (ES5) that is recognized by most modern browsers. This conversion is called transpilation.
