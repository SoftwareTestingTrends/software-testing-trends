There are many ways available to send HTTP request or make a REST API call during acceptance testing:

**1. HTTP - The standard library**
* default HTTP module in the standard Node.js library.
* No need to install any external dependency.
* It is NOT very user-friendly compared to other solutions.
* It does not parse the response data manually.
* It does not support HTTPS by default, so you need to require the https module instead if required.

**2. [Request](https://github.com/request/request) - Simplified HTTP client**
* An easy to use library that deals with HTTP requests
* For promise handling, use Bluebird or switch to request-promise library

**3. [Codecept REST API Helper](https://codecept.io/helpers/REST/)**
* This helper use unirest to perform requests.
* Provides easy to understand DSL  

**4. [Unirest](http://unirest.io/nodejs.html)** 
* Lightweight HTTP Request Client library
* Provides a cookie jar to store multiple cookies

**5. [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)**
* This is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
* Make http requests from node.js
* Supports the Promise API
* Intercept request and response
* Transform request and response data
* Cancel requests
* Automatic transforms for JSON data
* Client-side support for protecting against XSRF
* The request contains the following information:

  data: {},status, statusText, headers, config (the config that was provided to axios with request), request.

**6. [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)**
* A light-weight module that brings window.fetch to node.js
* Stay consistent with window.fetch API. 
* Use native promise, but allow substituting it with other popular promise libraries like Bluebird
* Use native Node streams for body, on both request and response.
* Useful extensions such as timeout, redirect limit, response size limit, explicit errors for troubleshooting.

**7. [request-promise](https://github.com/request/request-promise)**
* Simplified HTTP request client [**'request'**](https://github.com/request/request) with Promise support. Powered by Bluebird.
* request-promise wraps around request so everything that works with request also works with request-promise

**8. [SuperAgent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)**
* Makes AJAX requests from the browser
* Make http requests from node.js
* Provides a function `query()` to add parameters to the request.
* It parses the JSON response automatically.
