## Ultralearning - Take control of your learning
I recently read the book [Ultralearning by Scott H Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) and started applying the techniques I learned to my own learning.  I created a template that I started applying to all my new learning projects. The results were amazing. My learning is now more focused and more organized. Wanna know more about my Ultralearning template? Keep reading 😀 
## What is Ultralearning?

Ultralearning is a strategy for aggressive, self-directed learning.

It's a strategy — meaning a choice about how to pursue learning to get results.

It's aggressive — meaning aimed at doing what works, even if it's a little harder or intense.

It's self-directed — meaning you're the one in control. --Scott H Young
