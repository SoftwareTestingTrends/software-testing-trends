# Behavioral Interview Preparation

To answer behavioral job interview questions, you need to give real-life examples and stories. To answer it right, you need to follow the STAR method. As a reminder, the acronym stands for: S - Situation, T - Task, A - Action, R - Results. The format is quite straightforward to follow.

# Tell Me About Yourself.

## General Tips
- **Ask the interviewer**....My background is lengthy & diverse, is there any particular part of my background you'd like me to discuss?
- Keep your response specific to job description, that is what skill set the company is looking for such as: Based on the job description, I'd like to share my background as it relates to this.
- Here's my assumption about what the job entails and the skills that are required in order to be successful....
- Shift the **Focus on Future**, what company want to do and how your past experience matches with it.
- Why Do You Want the Job? Your ability to effectively articulate your qualifications and potential contributions. It all comes down to your ability to communicate how your qualifications match what the employer needs.

## Common Questions  
* Elevator speech max 2-3 secs, and what skills you bring to the company.
Address 3 questions in your intro:
   - Who you are? What you do?
   - For whom you do it?
   - How they benefit?
     
* Sample: 
   - I am a Senior Quality Engineer, helping organizations release a quality product by automating testing process.
   - I am a Senior Quality Engineer, who helps organizations optimize their testing process, so they can deliver a quality product on time, increase their revenue & reduce costs.
* Why did you choose to study Computer Science?
* Why did you decide to become a software engineer/developer/QA?
* What do you do in your spare time?
* What are your hobbies?
* What are you passionate about?
Sharing Knowledge - Knowledge is Power & Knowledge shared is power multiplied.

* Where would you like to be in your career five years from now?
* Tell us something that is not on your CV
 
----------------------------------------------------

# Work Experience
## Can you walk me through your resume?
Ask:

- Do you want me to start at the beginning and bring you current or do you want me to start today and go in reverse chronological order and work backwards to the beginning of my professional career, or you would like me to cherry pick those areas that I think are most important for you to know to determine whether I'm a good fit for the job, the things that I think best prepare me for the role?
- After describing every area, ask the interviewer, Is that enough there, Do you have any more questions about it? Did you want to discuss that any further? Should I go to the next point?
  
## Can you run me through your time at Company ABC?
Sample Answer: " Sure! I was working with Company ABC from 2016 to 2019. They’re one of the largest retailers in North America, and the company is valued at $2B. I was part of the ERP Team which focuses on ERP Projects internally for North America. Here I worked on Project X, where we had to complete an upgrade to ERP ABC. They had an older system in place and we were tasked with upgrading for our North American offices. As a Team, we were responsible for [describe responsibilities and targets, as well as Team outcome]. My personal involvement in the project was [describe your personal involvement, what you were tasked with, etc]. Ultimately I was able to [explain results you achieved for the team and company]”

----------------------------------------------------

# Interest In Company
## Why do you want to work at ABC Inc.?

Going through the job description, I feel I will be able to leverage my experience and make an impact right away.

Good people, interesting technologies, in a high-trust work environment.

I want to work at ABC Inc. for 3 main reasons:

1. **Technology Stack:** Purely technical, ABC is working with lots of new technologies that really excites me.
2. **Culture:** ABC's culture of moving fast...Unique culture...Social impact
3. **Domain** - e.g. eCommerce: Serving common people help them start their own business; Business Model.
4. **Digital By Default:** More Productive, Less Commute Stress, Getting more time to spend on learnings.

**Another Answer:**
I have 10 reasons I want to work here. I did a thorough research about Shopify before applying here, and I am very self-aware, I identified the things that makes me happy & I made a good decision of applying here.

- Market Leader in the space
- Career Development Opportunity
- Happy employees, my ex-collegues who joined are quite happy
- Great onboarding process

## Why do you want to leave your current job?
There are a few good approaches to answer "Why do you want to leave your current job?"  Here are some tips and positive reasons to focus on:

* **Career Growth:** This is a common and safe reason. You can say something like:
    * "I'm looking for an opportunity to take on more responsibility and grow my skills in [specific area]. I feel like I've reached a plateau in my current role, and this position seems like a great chance to take on new challenges."
* **Alignment with your goals:**  Express how this new opportunity aligns with your long-term career goals. For example: 
    * "I'm particularly interested in [aspect of the new company or role] because it aligns well with my long-term goal of working in [industry] and specializing in [specific area]." 
* **Work-life balance:** If that's a factor, you can be honest (but professional) about wanting a better balance. You could say:
     * "While I appreciate my current role, I'm looking for a position that offers a better work-life balance. This opportunity seems like it would allow me to [maintain a healthy work-life balance]."

**Here are some things to avoid:**

* **Negativity:** Don't badmouth your current employer or colleagues. 
* **Focus on the new role:** While it's okay to mention what excites you about the new position, keep the focus on why you're leaving your current job.

**Remember:** 

* Tailor your answer to the specific role you're interviewing for. 
* Be honest, but frame your reasons in a positive light. 
* Use this as an opportunity to show the interviewer how your reasons for leaving align with why you'd be a great fit for their company.

## What's your salary expectation?
- Never provide a salary expectation in the beginning
- Never provide a number; Ranges are no good either

**Best Answer:** Well, compensation is important to me, I really want to look at the entire value of working at your company; What I get to do, who I get to do, the training opportunities, the career advancement opportunities, the benefits, the vacation, and all the other things that go along with working at your organization. I am excited to learn about those in the interviewing process and toward the end I would be able to give you a much better idea of what it is that I would expect in terms of my salary based on all other factors. At the moment, to give you any kind of estimate would be uneducated on my part. I look forward to investigating those areas and I look forward to starting the interview process

**When asked about salary at the end of the process, answer as below:**

I am absolutely certain your are going to make me a fair offer. Just extend your offer, let me look at it, then I'll have a much better understanding of what the whole package looks like. And I'll very quickly give you feedback if not instantly, certainly within a day. Just give me a chance to think about it, and assemble my thoughts, and I'll come back to you.

# Strengths And Improvements

## What are your strengths
- I’m always up for a challenge and saying YES to new things.
- Being kind and compassionate, learning, sharing what I know, and amplifying the impact of those around me.
- I’m a huge accessibility advocate

One quote I like is: “You’re not starting from scratch, you’re starting from experience.” This helps me to put in perspective that although it’s a new language and framework and the syntax may be different—the semantics are the same

## What are your weaknesses?
- DO NOT actually provide them a with a weakness. 
- Do not use negative words such as “I’m bad at this” or “I’m not good at that” and so on.
- The best way to handle this question is to cite something you’ve yet to have the opportunity to do.

Say something such as: "One of my areas for improvement is [insert whatever here]. I’ve yet to have the opportunity to perform this function, work in this industry, study these things., etc.". At the end of your statement, make sure to add what you’ve done and are doing to gain experience in that area.

"…Even though I don’t have practical experience in that area, I’ve read [these] books, watched [these] videos, taken [these] training classes, and so on."

## Where did you add the greatest value?
- Making processes more efficient

## More Questions:
* What aspects of quality engineering do you think you're very good at? 
* What about areas where you'd like to improve? How do you plan on improving?

## Strong Disagreement
Describe a time when you strongly disagreed with a coworker about an engineering decision. How did you go about making the final decision? What did you do after the decision was made?

1. Philosophy
2. Process
3. Outcome

I have a story to share but first I want to share with you my philosophy about any disagreement, People have different approaches, goals, motivations. experiences.

I first try to step back & listen what they are saying & why. I want to make sure my mind is open.

What is the ultimate goal that we are trying to achieve? Finding the best solution. 

1. Dig Deep → Understand the perspective of every person (ideas, arguments, stances); How they came to their conclusion and how you came to your conclusion; Ask Why Questions. Try to find loop holes in their arguments. This will lead to the better decision.
   Don't attack people; Attack ideas.
2. Take a step back and see things from a higher level
3. Once the decision is made, commit to the decision. Move forward as it's your decision (if it's not yours). 

You can also do majority voting or escalate to the manager to take final decision (provide full context to them).

**Experience:** Automation Framework Design for Mobile Team (Ultimate Solution that was belnd of the two)

## Tell Me About a Time When You Influenced Someone
Note: Use same approach as for Disagreement with a twisted story.

## Tell me a time when you failed / What is your biggest failure?
