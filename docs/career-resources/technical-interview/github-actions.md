# Github Actions

1. **What is GitHub Actions?**
   - GitHub Actions is a CI/CD and automation platform provided by GitHub to help automate workflows and tasks in response to events in a GitHub repository.

2. **How is GitHub Actions different from other CI/CD platforms?**
   - GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with GitHub, making it easy to automate workflows directly within repositories. It also supports a variety of triggers and provides a marketplace for reusable actions.

3. **Explain the key components of a GitHub Actions workflow.**
   - Workflows consist of jobs, jobs consist of steps, and steps consist of individual actions. Workflows are defined in YAML files within the `.github/workflows` directory.

4. **How do you define a workflow in GitHub Actions?**
   - Workflows are defined in YAML files placed in the `.github/workflows` directory. They specify triggers, jobs, and steps to be executed.

5. **What are triggers in GitHub Actions?**
   - Triggers define events that initiate the execution of workflows. Examples include push events, pull request events, and scheduled events.

6. **How can secrets be managed and used in GitHub Actions?**
   - Secrets are managed in the repository settings, and they can be referenced in workflow files using the `secrets` context.

7. **What is a matrix in GitHub Actions?**
   - A matrix allows you to define multiple configuration sets for a job, enabling parallel execution of steps with different parameters.

8. **How do you use environment variables in GitHub Actions?**
   - Environment variables can be set and used in workflow files using the `env` context to pass information between steps.

9. **Explain the concept of caching in GitHub Actions.**
   - Caching allows you to store dependencies between workflow runs, speeding up the process by avoiding redundant operations.

10. **What are actions in GitHub Actions?**
    - Actions are reusable units of functionality that can be defined in separate repositories and used in workflows to perform specific tasks.

11. **How can you share and reuse actions in different repositories?**
    - Actions can be defined in separate repositories and referenced in workflows using the `uses` keyword, specifying the repository and version.

12. **What is the difference between self-hosted and GitHub-hosted runners?**
    - GitHub-hosted runners are managed by GitHub, while self-hosted runners are set up and managed on your own infrastructure.

13. **How do you debug and troubleshoot GitHub Actions workflows?**
    - Troubleshooting involves examining workflow run logs, exploring the visual workflow editor, and using `set-env` and `echo` commands for debugging.

14. **What are artifacts in GitHub Actions?**
    - Artifacts allow you to persist data between jobs in a workflow, enabling the sharing of data across different steps.

15. **How do you deploy applications using GitHub Actions?**
    - Deploying applications involves defining deployment jobs in workflows, using relevant actions or scripts, and configuring deployment targets.
